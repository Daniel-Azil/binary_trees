# Binary Tree

This repository contains an implementation of a binary tree data structure in the C programming language. A binary tree is a fundamental data structure widely used in computer science and software development for tasks like searching, sorting, and hierarchical data representation.

## Features

- Implementation of a binary tree with key features like insertion, deletion, and traversal (in-order, pre-order, and post-order).
- A well-structured and documented C codebase, making it easy to understand and learn from.
- A valuable resource for anyone looking to grasp the concepts of binary trees or needing a base implementation for other projects.

## Usage

You can use the code in this repository to understand how binary trees work and as a reference for your own C projects. The code is open for exploration and can be a starting point for customizations or extensions.
